Linked Out
==========
This is a bash shell script that can be used to see if your password was leaked in the linked in hack.  You can run it from your terminal and it should work in mac or linux (sorry windows users). It does not connect to the internet or store your passwords so you don't have to trust any 3rd party to not keep a copy of your password.
